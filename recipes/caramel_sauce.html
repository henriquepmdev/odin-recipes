    <h2>The thick and gooey caramel sauce of your dreams is easier and faster than you think.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vanilla pod</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine water, sugar, and salt over medium heat. If you like, add an empty vanilla pod, too. Stir with a fork until syrup comes to a boil, about 4 minutes, then simmer without stirring until syrup is honey-colored, roughly 6 minutes, shaking and swirling as needed to ensure even caramelization. Continue cooking until syrup is light to medium amber, a minute more. Immediately add cream and reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
        <li>Stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula to knock back the foam, simmer until caramel registers 225°F (107°C) on a digital thermometer, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a heat-resistant container, stir in vanilla extract (if using), and cool to room temperature. (No need to discard the vanilla bean; it will continue to infuse the caramel over time.) Caramel will be runny while warm, but thicken as it cools, turning just a little chewy when cold. Refrigerate up to 1 month in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
